= Stats

The `stats` command analyzes the Redis database and displays keyspace statistics as well as keys that could be **problematic** during a live replication.

The basic usage is:

[source,console]
----
riotx stats [OPTIONS]
----

For the full usage, run:
[source,console]
----
riotx stats --help
----

`--mem <size>`:: Memory usage threshold above which a key is considered big

`--rate <size>`:: Write bandwidth above which a key is considered problematic.


.Example: Keys over 3MB in memory usage and 10MB in write rate
[source,console]
----
riotx stats --mem 3mb --rate 10mb
----
