From Scotland, this malt is still produced in the tradition of turning over the barley by hand, resulting in a malt that is unsurpassed in its quality. Golden Promise is also used extensively by premium whisky distilleries such as The Macallan. This malt provides the backbone for the intense hop character. Four American hop varieties are used at a rate of over three pounds per barrel. The result is a rich malt sweetness infused with bright hop flavor and aroma from beginning to end.

The mills are  gone now, but the smokestacks still stand testament to Bend's humble beginnings. \n\nBuzzsaw Brown is an easy-drinking beer that is refreshing after a hard day's work. The timber mills in Bend may be closed, but whether your adventure includes a day of scaling rock faces, hitting 18 holes or skiing the slopes in spring, Buzzsaw Brown is the perfect end to a fun-filled day.\n\nâ€œBuzzsaw Brown is one of my favorite beers,â€ says Deschutes Brewery Brewmaster Larry Sidor. â€œThe unique combination of European and American malts makes it a very food friendly beer that pairs well with a wide variety of flavors.â€",

        "descript": "Great Divide's award-winning Hibernation Ale is Colorado's original strong ale – it has been our winter seasonal each year since 1995. Since that time, Hibernation has become the most sought-after winter beer in Colorado. Hibernation's massive flavors are so intense that it requires over three months of aging each year. Each summer, while our brewers are still spending their weekends in flip-flops and shorts, they prepare for July's Hibernation brewing schedule.\n\nWe cellar Hibernation until late October, when it reaches the peak of perfection. This lengthy aging process gives Hibernation its revered malty richness, complex hop profile and hearty warming character, which is perfect right out of the bottle or cellared for longer periods of time. Hibernation is a lively treat that really beats the winter chill. This scrumptious, collectible, and imminently cellarable ale is only available for six weeks each year, from November 1 to December 15.  Hibernation Ale is the perfect gift or accompaniment to your winter festivities.",

It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a \"black Pils,\" but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.\n\nIn a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass.",

Instead, we brew Titan IPA for hop disciples – independent beer drinkers seeking out robust, flavorful beers characterized by their abundance of hops flavor, aroma and bitterness.

For those that have the gift of passion for the dark side, it's measured in pints of Oatmeal Stout. Another one of FiftyFifty's seasonals, the Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is brown to black in color and nearly opaque. It has a velvet like mouthfeel, moderate hints of dark dried fruit, espresso beans and Dark Chocolate... and just a hint of hop bitterness. The addition of Flaked Oats gives this brew its wonderful creamy texture. Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is one of a series of Stouts that FiftyFifty Brewing Co. will produce during the course of the year. Enjoy!",

This beer is a delight for those who take pleasure in craft beers and are looking for something that they can enjoy a few pints of.

This bold stout boasts a rich, caramel sweetness lavished by a robust, deep-roasted heartiness you can sink your teeth into. ...Big Bear's bold flavors are produced using a blend of Belgian and English roasted barley and crystal malts. Some unique flavors come forth in the malt character. ...Louisiana sweet molasses and dark brown sugar. This dark brew is well hopped with Chinook and Cascade hops, which are somewhat, masked by the malt. This is a balanced bold brew boasting an A.V.B. of 8.1% that can creep up on you, \"so don't get mauled\". It has a dry roasted quality that masks its' high alchohol content, so drink responsibly. 2004 California State Fair, Silver Medal Winner; 2002 World Beer Cup, Gold Medal Winner; \n2002 Annual Bistro Beer Festival, Hayward, Gold Medal Winner; 2001 North American Brewers' Award, Honorable Mention - og 1.076, ABV 8.1%, IBU 68.",
